# Modify this file to change the available enchanting paths.
# New paths can be added, existing paths can be modified.
#
# This will change the overall behavior of how wands upgrade when put in an enchanting table.

# See enchanting.defaults.yml for the defaults, and for more details.

#
# This is the Enchanthing configuration file for the Magic plugin.
#
# This defines the randomization paths for wands, used in several places:
#
# - Wand crafting
# - Wand enchanting
# - Block populator
#
# The randomization system works with "levels".
# When enchanting, these map directly to the number of xp levels a player spends.
# When creating a random wand, you can specify a level like random(23).
# The default "/wand random" will give you a level-1 random wand. This is also what the crafting table generates.
#
# An enchanting table with no bookshelves can add about 27 levels to a wand at one time. A full bookshelf table
# can add about 40. This is used to try to give out the "big" spells to only the high-level enchanting tables.
#
# The "levels" line defines the level thresholds. This list is used in all of the following lists, think of it
# as the column headers.
#
# The randomization blocks create a lookup table that is used to randomly choose values based on the input level.
# (Note that the actual values are interpolated based on the provided level and the thresholds set.)
# The key in a randomization block is the output. The values separated by columns are weights that match to the level
# in the same column in the "levels" list. Higher weights mean higher probability for that value at that level threshold.
#
# For example:
#
# # Define level thresholds at 1, 20, 30 and 40.
# levels: 1,20,30,40
# # Add spells to a wand
# spell_count:
# # levels:  1  20   30    40
#       1: 99,  85, 100,   100
#       2: 1,   10,  60,   100
#       3: 0,   5,   20,   70
#       4: 0,   0,   10,   60
#
# At level 1, a wand has a 99% chance of getting 1 spell added to it, and a 1% chance of 2 spells.
# At level 20, a wand has an 85% chane of getting 1 spell, 10% chance of 2 spells, and a 5% chance of 3
#
# Levels between 1 and 20 will be scaled linearly between the two.
# The same logic is applies for levels 20-30 and 30-40.
#
# Note that the actual values need not add up to 100- and generally do not. This is much easier to tweak, but also generally
# harder to comprehend when looking at the numbers- I'm thinking about ways to clean that up.
