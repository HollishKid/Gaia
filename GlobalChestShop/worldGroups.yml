#	In this file you can customize what worlds share a single economy (WorldGroup).
#	Worlds that are not listed here will be ignored by the plugin.
#
#	WARNING: If you are running a network of servers with multiple instances of this plugin and 
#	they all share a single MySql-Database, it is very important every world in you Bungee-Network
#	has a unique name. Also you want to make sure this file looks the same on all your servers!
#
#
#	Once you are using this plugin inside a world, you should not rename the world later on!
#
#
# 	Here is an example of how this file could look like:
#
#
#WorldGroup:
#  1:
#    - world
#    - world_nether
#    - world_the_end
#  2:
#    - world_skyBlock
#    - world_skyBlockLobby
#  3:
#    - plotWorld
#    - world_creative
#
# ___________________________________________________________________________________________________
WorldGroup:
  1:
    - Gaia
    - Gaia_nether
    - Gaia_the_end
